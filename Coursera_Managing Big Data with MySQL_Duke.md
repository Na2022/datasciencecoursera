#Week 1

***Cardinality constraints***
Numbers take precedence over symbols in ER;
***Underlined in paretheses***
If you combine the values of building and room number together, you'll get a unique identifier or key that will be different for every row in the table or more formally, for every entity instance.

***Entity instance***

A single occurrence of an entity type, e.g. a row in a table

***Unique attribute***

An attribute with a unique value in each entity instance, e.g. the column that allows you to link tables together
